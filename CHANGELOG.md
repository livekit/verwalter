# Changelog

## 0.3.0-rc.1

### Minor Changes

- `verwalter pre-release <package>` opens an rc PR for one package on demand, against any branch. The rc bumps the package's own files and changelog, keeps the changesets pending, and is tagged as a pre-release after the merge. Pre-release tags no longer count as releases for changesets.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- `verwalter release --asset <file>` attaches files when the GitHub release is created, so a workflow can build first and needs no draft. `verwalter release --abandon <tag>` deletes a release and its tag.
